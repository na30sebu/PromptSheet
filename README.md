Plot Holes
How alkali metal reacts to turmeric 

How the body, converts all the alkali metal into something else and how by the
time one urinates, the urine is completely without any trace of the alkali metal
and why

how alkali metal could destabilize atoms in all organisms and how that could
change a living being such as a human if they were to destabilize

how someone working at a gas station / hardware store could have learned 
about all this in past experiences while at work for both in minutes or in years

Difference Between Books and Courses

Books 
- Books offer comprehensive knowledge at a low cost: They 
typically contain all the essential information needed to complete 
a task and are usually priced under $100.
- Technical skills are best learned through official resources: 
Manuals, documentation, wikis, and YouTube tutorials tend to be
the most effective sources for tech learning.
- Human skills are best developed through specialized books: 
Topics like cross‑functional collaboration, project management, 
and conflict resolution are well-covered in dedicated books.
- Audiobooks become cost‑effective when purchased with Audible
credits, and Kindle books can be read aloud through a voice 
assistant. Both options work well for busy people who value 
convenience, and easy‑access learning.

Courses:
- Courses provide structure and accountability: They can cost up
to $500 and are often geared toward individuals with higher
incomes who want guided support.
- Udemy (Cheap Courses):
Monthly deals — at least once per month
Seasonal/holiday sales — major ones every 1–2 months
Flash sales — sprinkled throughout the year
New user discounts — always available

CON: "I find Udemy hard to access in practice since I never feel 
motivated to go to the site or use the app.”

Style, is similar to having an opinion—which is really just a theory from someone who hasn't figured everything out. Why would someone choose your style? It emerges as much from your omissions and dislikes as from your deliberate choices. Why would people choose to listen to you in the future when they could just talk to AI all the time, without needing a keyboard or a break? Even when you use AI to make things, all of us are vulnerable at times, and that is what connects all of us, to one another. If you remain headstrong past the negative opinions of others—whether something that happens is good or bad—just focus on the facts. And well then, why wouldn't they? Sometimes it takes a while for all of us to discover things for what they really are.

Fused and Defused Thinking:
- Fused thinking is where you're working and focused on your project.
- Defused thinking is when you're away and taking a break from your project,
and you are completely doing something else and you are not focused on it.
That is when you have all your best ideas or when you realize solutions to the
problems or projects, you are working on.

Things I Want To Try Out:
Google Antigravity
- Is used by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds.
Blockbench
- Simpler than Blender
- Can convert Pixel Art items to Models for 3D inventory.
- You still have to learn how to design with Low-Poly 3D, 
and with Textures.
